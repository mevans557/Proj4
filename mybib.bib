  abstract = {Tipping points associated with bifurcations (B-tipping) or induced by noise (N-tipping) are recognized mechanisms that may potentially lead to sudden climate change. We focus here a novel class of tipping points, where a sufficiently rapid change to an input or parameter of a system may cause the system to "tip" or move away from a branch of attractors. Such rate-dependent tipping, or R-tipping, need not be associated with either bifurcations or noise. We present an example of all three types of tipping in a simple global energy balance model of the climate system, illustrating the possibility of dangerous rates of change even in the absence of noise and of bifurcations in the underlying quasi-static system.},

  abstract = {Models of disease spreading are critical for predicting infection growth in a population and evaluating public health policies. However, standard models typically represent the dynamics of disease transmission between individuals using macroscopic parameters that do not accurately represent person-to-person variability. To address this issue, we present a dynamic network model that provides a straightforward way to incorporate both disease transmission dynamics at the individual scale as well as the full spatiotemporal history of infection at the population scale. We find that disease spreads through a social network as a traveling wave of infection, followed by a traveling wave of recovery, with the onset and dynamics of spreading determined by the interplay between disease transmission and recovery. We use these insights to develop a scaling theory that predicts the dynamics of infection for diverse diseases and populations. Furthermore, we show how spatial heterogeneities in susceptibility to infection can either exacerbate or quell the spread of disease, depending on its infectivity. Ultimately, our dynamic network approach provides a simple way to model disease spreading that unifies previous findings and can be generalized to diverse diseases, containment strategies, seasonal conditions, and community structures.},

  abstract = {We introduce an epidemic spreading model on a network using concepts from percolation theory. The model is motivated by discussing the standard SIR model, with extensions to describe effects of lockdowns within a population. The underlying ideas and behaviour of the lattice model, implemented using the same lockdown scheme as for the SIR scheme, are discussed in detail and illustrated with extensive simulations. A comparison between both models is presented for the case of COVID-19 data from the USA. Both fits to the empirical data are very good, but some differences emerge between the two approaches which indicate the usefulness of having an alternative approach to the widespread SIR model.},

  abstract = {We study epidemic spreading in complex networks by a multiple random walker approach. Each walker performs an independent simple Markovian random walk on a complex undirected (ergodic) random graph where we focus on the Barab{\'a}si--Albert (BA), Erd{\"o}s--R{\'e}nyi (ER), and Watts--Strogatz (WS) types. Both walkers and nodes can be either susceptible (S) or infected and infectious (I), representing their state of health. Susceptible nodes may be infected by visits of infected walkers, and susceptible walkers may be infected by visiting infected nodes. No direct transmission of the disease among walkers (or among nodes) is possible. This model mimics a large class of diseases such as Dengue and Malaria with the transmission of the disease via vectors (mosquitoes). Infected walkers may die during the time span of their infection, introducing an additional compartment D of dead walkers. Contrary to the walkers, there is no mortality of infected nodes. Infected nodes always recover from their infection after a random finite time span. This assumption is based on the observation that infectious vectors (mosquitoes) are not ill and do not die from the infection. The infectious time spans of nodes and walkers, and the survival times of infected walkers, are represented by independent random variables. We derive stochastic evolution equations for the mean-field compartmental populations with the mortality of walkers and delayed transitions among the compartments. From linear stability analysis, we derive the basic reproduction numbers RM,R0 with and without mortality, respectively, and prove that RM1, the healthy state is unstable, whereas for zero mortality, a stable endemic equilibrium exists (independent of the initial conditions), which we obtained explicitly. We observed that the solutions of the random walk simulations in the considered networks agree well with the mean-field solutions for strongly connected graph topologies, whereas less well for weakly connected structures and for diseases with high mortality. Our model has applications beyond epidemic dynamics, for instance in the kinetics of chemical reactions, the propagation of contaminants, wood fires, and others.},
